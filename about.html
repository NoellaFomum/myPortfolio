                    <section class="invisible"></section>
                    <p>My journey from a background in Economics to my current roles as a frontend developer and a data
                        engineer has been an amazing path so far.</p>
                    <p>Having studied Economics, I developed a strong analytical mindset and a deep understanding of
                        market dynamics and trends. These skills have been invaluable in my transition to the tech
                        industry. As a frontend developer, I leverage my economic background to create user-friendly
                        interfaces that enhance the overall user experience. I apply economic principles to design
                        intuitive layouts and optimize user interactions, ultimately driving user engagement and
                        satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>In my role as a data engineer, I utilize my analytical skills to extract meaningful insights from
                        complex datasets. My background in Economics has equipped me with the ability to identify
                        patterns, trends, and correlations within data, enabling me to develop robust data pipelines and
                        implement efficient data processing solutions. By combining my economic expertise with technical
                        proficiency, I am able to deliver data-driven solutions that drive business growth and
                        innovation.</p>
                    <p>Overall, my journey from Economics to frontend development and data engineering has been a
                        rewarding experience. I am constantly learning and adapting to new technologies and
                        methodologies, leveraging my diverse skill set to tackle complex challenges and drive impactful
                        results. I am excited to continue growing and evolving in these dynamic roles, contributing my
                        unique perspective and expertise to the ever-evolving tech landscape.</p>
