                    <p>Outside of work, I'm a Humanitarian, I used to Volunteer for an Organisation called CPWED. CPWED
                        which stands for Co-operation for Peace, Women Empowerment and Democracy was founded by my
                        Friends and I. Most often on Saturdays, My friends and I participate in community outreach
                        programs, organizing events to raise awareness about social injustices, and teaching courses on
                        sociology to educate others about the complexities of human behavior in society. We also raise
                        funds to Empower young girls and single mothers. We do reach out to the homeless and orphans.
                    </p>
                    <p>Family is my greatest priority after Humanity, out of 11, I'm the 8th Born. I owe a lot to My Father, who is the backbone
                        behind the person I am today and even in future. I learned and still learning so much from my
                        father. Unfortunately distance has made a difference this time around.
                        I enjoy having conversations with my mum, my step mum and my Siblings. I love my Family so very
                        much.
